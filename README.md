# DataVisualization

This is a simple dashboard. 
We will embed google chart that is generated from the google sheets to the dashboard. 
Based on the address that we have in the google sheets, we will get the longitude and latitude, then we will use the Google Map API to access the longitude and latitude of each location and add a red marker for each location that shown in the google map.
We also add an info window for each marker that we have and show its address respectively.
